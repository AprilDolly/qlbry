# qlbry
A basic client for LBRY and Odysee! Still kind of early in development, so it doesn't have too many features yet

## Usage

### Linux

1) Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/AprilDolly/qlbry/releases/tag/stuff).

2) In a terminal, type `chmod +x qlbry.AppImage`

3) Double click to run it, or type `./qlbry.AppImage` in the terminal.

### Windows

Will come soon. For now, you will have to download python and manually install the dependencies, I'm afraid :c
